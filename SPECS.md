# Plannies Mate Specifications

Plannies Mate is a Ruby command-line tool that analyzes PlanningAlerts scrapers to extract unique identifiers and terms.

This helps the "Cricky, what's that?" frontend tool identify which scraper to use for different council websites,
minimizing the need to check repositories added after this analysis.

- IMPLEMENTATION.md - Detailed implementation guidance and algorithms
- GUIDELINES.md - Guidelines for AI assistants and developers

Note: README.md contains installation and usage instructions which are not relevant for AIs.

## REQUIREMENTS

* Creating `log/scraper_analysis.js`
* Validate internal and output files against these specifications
* the different stages of processing must be separate so they can be run and validated independently against the
  relevant specifications

## Scraper Language Classification

Detect what language each repo is by the scraper file so you know how to recognize passive lines.

| Language | Scraper file | Comments start with | echo command | import command |
| Ruby | scraper.rb | # | puts | Bundler.require |
| PHP | scraper.php | // | echo | require_once |
| Python | scraper.py | # | print | import |
| Perl | scraper.pl | # | print | use |
| Node.js | scraper.js | // | console.log | require |

### scraper_analysis.js format

This file is the main requirement, as the file is copied to the "Cricky, what's that?" project.

This file MUST contain:

* `export const scraperDateTime` - with the latest updated_at time across all repos

* `export const scraperData` - a hash of repo name from Github to the following details
    * description - the description of the repo from Github
    * words_from_urls - an array of non-dictionary words extracted from URLs
    * words_from_strings - an array of non-dictionary words extracted from code strings
    * url_patterns - an array of meaningful URL patterns for the scraper

* `export const ignoreWords` - a list of words that where and/or should be ignored. formed from:
    * words extracted from urls that where identified as dictionary words by `aspell` command
    * words from COMMON_WORDS constant
    * words extracted from repo name and description that where identified as dictionary words by `aspell` command

```javascript
// Generated by Plannies Mate at 2025-01-29 11:40:09 +11:00
// for 31 active scrapers

// the date and time the github repo list was last checked and downloaded
export const scraperDateTime = "2025-01-29T23:33:13Z";

export const scraperData = {
    'yarra': {
        description: "Yarra City Development Applications",
        words_from_strings: ["nodeid"],
        words_from_urls: ["myplanning", "xearch"],
        url_patterns: ["/myplanning-application-xsearch"]
    },
    'act': {
        description: "ACT Planning Portal Scraper",
        words_from_strings: ["search-results"],
        words_from_urls: ["fromdate"],
        url_patterns: ["/applications-and-assessments/development-applications"]
    }
    // ... more scrapers
};

export const ignoreWords = [
    "scraper",
    "scrapers"
];

```

### Word Extraction Rules

Both this and the "Cricky Whats That?" projects MUST follow this algorithm so search words match!

Process files by:

1. extract

* all urls in the form: `/https?:\/\/[^'"]+/`
    - remove the leading scheme and hostname using: `/https?:\/\/[^\/]*/`
* extract all single-quoted and double-quoted strings

2. extract all sequences of `/([-_a-z0-9]+)/i` which are called words for this project
    - Note, this means there is No special handling of
    - camelCase (becomes one word),
    - snake_case or kebab-case (becomes one word)
3. ignore words that are:
    - 1 or 2 characters long
    - appear in the COMMON_WORDS list
    - are dictionary words as filtered out by `aspell list`
4. lowercase all text (after check with `aspell`)

#### Example Word Extraction

```
Input URL: https://www.yarracity.vic.gov.au/MyPlanning-application-xsearch
Extracted words: ["myplanning-application-xearch"]

Input URL: https://www.planning.act.gov.au/program/development_applications?fromDate=20251012
Extracted words: ["development_applications", fromdate"]

Lines:
      address: street_address + ", " + a["SUBURB"] + ", ACT",
      description: a["PROPOSAL_TEXT"],
Extracted words: ["proposal_text"]
```

## Dependencies

Fail fast with message if missing where required for processing

- Ruby 3.3 or newer
- aspell (specifically `aspell list`)
- Git
- gems listed in `Gemfile`
- Github API for repository information

### Data formats

#### github repo format

Request non-archived PlanningAlerts repo list from Github using
[standard call](https://github.com/orgs/planningalerts-scrapers/repositories.json?q=archived%3Afalse)

A yml file `config/private_repos.yml` containing a hash of repo names to descriptions will also be merged in as it is not
otherwise available without authentication.

Note

- a "pageCount" is returned, append `&page=N` to the url above for 2nd and subsequent pages
- normally a page of 30 records is returned, but just accept what is given and work off page
  numbers

An example of two records is as follows:

```json
{
  "payload": {
    "pageCount": 2,
    "repositories": [
      {
        "type": "Public",
        "name": "bawbaw",
        "description": "Baw Baw Shire Council Planning Applications",
        "lastUpdated": {
          "hasBeenPushedTo": true,
          "timestamp": "2019-05-18T00:38:15.692Z"
        },
        ...
      },
      {
        "type": "Public",
        "name": "townsville",
        "description": "Townsville City Council Development Applications",
        "lastUpdated": {
          "hasBeenPushedTo": true,
          "timestamp": "2019-05-07T23:08:34.542Z"
        },
        ...
      }
    ]
  }
} 
```
