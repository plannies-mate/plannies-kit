# Plannies Mate

A tool to analyze PlanningAlerts scrapers and extract unique identifiers and terms. These help the "Cricky, what's
that?" frontend tool identify which scraper to use for different council websites.

Note: This README focuses on installation and usage. For development:
- See GUIDELINES.md for development guidelines
- See SPECS.md for requirements and architecture
- See IMPLEMENTATION.md for implementation details

## Dependencies

- Ruby 3.3 or newer
- Aspell (`brew install aspell` on macOS, `apt-get install aspell` on Ubuntu)
- Git

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/plannies-mate.git
   cd plannies-mate
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   bundle install
   ```

## Usage

Run the entire process:

```bash
./script/process
```

Or run individual scripts with optional LIMIT parameter:

```bash
./lib/download.rb repos        # Downloads all repositories to repos/ AND updates status/download_run.json and status/descriptions.json
./lib/download.rb repos 5      # Downloads only 5 repositories
./lib/cleanup.rb repos         # Removes test files, binary files and .git directories
./lib/analyze.rb repos         # Analyzes code and outputs terms
```

And run individual validate scripts with optional LIMIT parameter:

```bash
./lib/validate/download.rb repos        # Validates at least 40 repositories where downloaded but less than 50
./lib/validate/download.rb repos 5      # Validates at least 5 repositories where downloaded and less than 50
./lib/validate/cleanup.rb repos         # Validates test files, binary files and .git directories are missing from repos
./lib/validate/analyze.rb repos         # Validates output from Analyzes in log/*
```

The analysis generates:

- `log/scraper_analysis.js`: Words and descriptions for frontend use AND date download was run
- `log/debug_analysis.json`: Full analysis including URLs (for debugging)

## Scripts

- `lib/download.rb`: Downloads PlanningAlerts scraper repositories. Supports optional LIMIT parameter for testing
- `lib/cleanup.rb`: Removes test files, binary files, test directories, and .git directories
- `lib/analyze.rb`: Extracts unique non-dictionary terms from code files
- `script/process`: Runs all scripts in sequence
- `script/clobber`: Removes the repos directory
